        	<h2>Where to stay</h2>
        	<p>All hotels and resorts in Cayo Largo are 10 minutes away from the airport and about 15 minutes from the village and marina. They are all located on the south coast of the island and within 5 km to Playa Lindarena.</p>            
   	        <p>Most of them offer an all-inclusive package which includes all meals, drinks, entertainment, activities and so on. Be aware that there are no services between hotels in Cayo Largo which means that you cannot drink or eat in another hotel but the one you are staying, unless you have a special authorization. Breakfast is usually served from 07:30 to 10:30, lunch goes from 13:00 to 14:45 and dinner from 19:30 to 22:00.</p>
<p>All hotels have a swimming pool and offer beach towels rent for free that can be also brought to the beach.</p> 
			<h2>When to go</h2>
			<p>Cayo Largo has an almost eternal summer with its sub-tropical climate. Temperatures usually average from 22 to 30 degrees Celsius during the day. The temperatures in there are generally a few degrees higher than most cities of the main island of Cuba.</p>
			<p>There are only two seasons in Cayo Largo, the dry season from November to April and the wet season from May to October. However, even during the wet season the precipitations are relatively low, it rarely rains during the day. Showers are usually strong but quickly and seem to occur mostly at night or early morning.</p>
			<p>During the dry season evenings can sometimes be a relatively cold, so it's recommended to trousers and a not so light jacket just in case. The temperatures in the wet season are very hot (30C+) and the high humidity makes it feel even hotter.</p>
