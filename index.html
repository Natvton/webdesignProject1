		 	<h2>The Island</h2>
        	<p>Cayo Largo, or Cayo Largo der Sur, is a remote island located in the north of the Caribbean Sea and approximately 80km south from the main Island of Cuba. An almost virgin island, non-commercial quite place, perfect for people looking for beautiful nature far away from city life.</p>
		    <p>The 20km long and 3km wide island offers more than 20km of beautiful white sand beaches with impressive blue sea. In Cayo Largo it is possible to observe a large variety of birds such as the Brown Eagle (picture bellow), rich sea-life, as well as iguanas (many of them!) and even a couple of crocodiles. See <a href="page4.html" target="_blank">galery</a> if you don't believe me ;).</p>

        	<h2>A Bit of History</h2>
            <p>The name Cayo Largo comes from its long shape. Its history dates from the aboriginal period, since remains and artefacts from the Siboney culture have been found on island. It is said that Christopher Columbus has visited the island on his expedition in 1494, and Sir Francis Drake has also made the island a visit during his circumnavigation of the globe. Cayo Largo is known to be the place chosen by pirates and corsairs to hide the treasures conquered or ransacked during their adventures across seas. A cross was erected by one of those pirates as a symbol of conquest and enforcement of their customs and habits.</p>
		    <p>Years later, slaves running away from Spanish colonialism found the cross to which they offered a religious ceremony, blessing it with the rites of their gods, resulting from religious syncretism. The duty to protect the land was then assigned to the cross.</p>
