        	    The hotel can arrange for a doctor to come to your room if needed. Also, you  can see the doctor directly in a mini-clinic of certain Hotels or at the  polyclinic located in the village. Doctors are available 24 hours a day and the  cost vary depending on the time of the day and care received. <br>

        	    In Cuba no vaccine is mandatory but the Twinrix (Hepatitis A + B) is advised.<br>
       	        The clinic in the village is for minor injuries and basic treatments so in the  case of serious injuries you will be immediately transported to Havana. There  is also a dental clinic.</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold"> BEAUTY SALON</span><br>
        	  There is a beauty salon in the major Hotels and they are often located in the  same building of gym and spa facilities:<br>

        	  Most hotels in Cayo Largo offer professional massage whether in private room or  in a hut near the pool or beach.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">INTERNET</span><br>

        	  It costs 10 CUC per hour  and the connection is quite slow.</p>
        	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">PHONES</span><br>
        	  Here are the communication fees at Cuba:<br>
        	  Local: 0.10 @ 0.60 CUC/minute<br>

        	  There is only one paved road which connects the hotels to the airport and the  village. The driving is on the right side. There are a few other roads but they  are small sandy trails, so take care if you rent a scooter. Driving under the  influence of alcohol is a very serious offence in Cuba so be very careful.</p>

   	    	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">WATER</span><br>
You can drink water in the hotels, however, is doesn’t taste good. You can buy  a bottle of water and ask for a (free) refill of purified water at the bar in  the hotels.
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">MOSQUITOS</span><br>
Mosquitos tend to be a popular complaint between tourists in Cayo Largo  especially during summer. They usually appear only at sunset, but it depends on  the climatic conditions (mainly humidity). Hotels god the surrounding every  night as a preventive measure; however, it is recommended that you bring a good  insect spray repellent.</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">MONEY</span><br>
There are two currencies available in Cuba, CUPs which are generally used by  the Cubans and CUCs that are used by both, foreign and Cubans. All cash  purchases in Cuba are made in CUC or CUP, no other foreign currency is accepted  in the island. Tipping is expected and made in CUC.<br>
You get the best exchange rate in banks; however, the most convenient way is to  exchange your money, for a little bit higher rate, in a Cadeca which is the  official government’s currency exchange house. They can be found everywhere  including airports and most hotels and resorts. You can also exchange it in  most hotel receptions but the rate is usually a lot higher. Your passport is  required to exchange money at a bank or Cadeca but not at the hotels. It is  important to note that USD exchange rate against CUC is different, a 10% tax is  added to avoid bringing US dollars to the island. <br>
The Banco Nacional de Cuba publishes the official daily exchange rates in its  website: <a href="http://www.bc.gob.cu/">www.bc.gob.cu</a></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Cards:</span> <br>
MasterCard and Visa cards  (from a non-US bank) are accepted in most hotels, resorts, restaurants, stores  and tours agencies. They can also be used in banks or Cadecas to withdraw  money. Only Visa or MasterCard Debit cards work in Cuba but in an ATM only the  Visa one.</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Language:</span> Spanish<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">Required documents:</span> Valid passport + Visa Tourist Card</p>
